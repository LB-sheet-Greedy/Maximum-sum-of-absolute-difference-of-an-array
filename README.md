# Maximum-sum-of-absolute-difference-of-an-array

Question >>

Given an array, we need to find the maximum sum of absolute difference of any permutation of the given array.

Examples >>

Input : { 1, 2, 4, 8 }
Output : 18
Explanation : For the given array there are 
several sequence possible
like : {2, 1, 4, 8}
       {4, 2, 1, 8} and some more.
Now, the absolute difference of an array sequence will be
like for this array sequence {1, 2, 4, 8}, the absolute
difference sum is 
= |1-2| + |2-4| + |4-8| + |8-1|
= 14
For the given array, we get the maximum value for
the sequence {1, 8, 2, 4}
= |1-8| + |8-2| + |2-4| + |4-1|
= 18
